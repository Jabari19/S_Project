                <p>
                    This week, I worked 15 hours on the internship, bringing my total to 45 hours for the term. 
                    My goal for the week was to gather and organize healthcare data for analyzing provider performance. 
                    I made good progress in collecting data from different sources and started sorting it into categories, 
                    like patient outcomes and provider efficiency. One challenge I faced was dealing with missing or incomplete data. 
                    To address this, I cross-referenced multiple datasets and reached out to the team for clarification on specific entries. 
                    For next week, I plan to finish organizing the data and start creating visual summaries to highlight key performance trends.

                <h3>Journal Entry Topic</h3>
                <p>Looking at healthcare software, EHR (Electronic Health Records), it was easy for me to identify some issues that can be fixed. It is slow and has some unnecessary features. I can take that software and clean it up by removing some of these unnecessary features, which I believe make the software lag, frustrating healthcare workers (nurses).
                    Last quarter, I studied database management systems, which I will also use in my project to help gather and organize data.
                    Last quarter, I also worked on a project in cloud computing, and I am very confident that if I apply it to my project, it will help store most data in the cloud and allow me to manage it more efficiently.</p>
                    <b>Soft Skills</b>
                    <p>I am a team player. I work really well with others, collaborating and helping team projects achieve a common goal.
                    I also adapt quickly to new tools or technology. For instance, I started learning Ruby, and I have come to like it.
                    I am good at time management, ensuring tasks are organized and completed on time to maintain productivity and meet deadlines, especially when juggling multiple projects. I like to prioritize tasks by identifying the most urgent ones and breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps.
