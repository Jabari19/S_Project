                <p>Looking at healthcare software, EHR (Electronic Health Records), it was easy for me to identify some issues that can be fixed. It is slow and has some unnecessary features. I can take that software and clean it up by removing some of these unnecessary features, which I believe make the software lag, frustrating healthcare workers (nurses).
                    Last quarter, I studied database management systems, which I will also use in my project to help gather and organize data.
                    Last quarter, I also worked on a project in cloud computing, and I am very confident that if I apply it to my project, it will help store most data in the cloud and allow me to manage it more efficiently.</p>
                    <b>Soft Skills</b>
                    <p>I am a team player. I work really well with others, collaborating and helping team projects achieve a common goal.
                    I also adapt quickly to new tools or technology. For instance, I started learning Ruby, and I have come to like it.
                    I am good at time management, ensuring tasks are organized and completed on time to maintain productivity and meet deadlines, especially when juggling multiple projects. I like to prioritize tasks by identifying the most urgent ones and breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps.

By having my supervisor recommend me, I’m more likely to get noticed and find a way into departments like IT, where I want to grow. My supervisor’s support makes it easier for me to connect with people and shows that I am trustworthy. Over time, this can lead to more opportunities and better connections across the company.
                    
                    <b>Mentorship</b> is another good strategy for me. In the past, I have worked with people who helped me become better at my job and achieve more. A mentor can give me advice, share their experiences, and help me make important career choices. They can also motivate me and give me feedback on my work. Having a mentor with experience in areas I want to learn about can teach me things I might not get from formal training. This will help me improve faster and become better at my job.
                    
                    By using both referral networking and mentorship, I can build a strong support system. This will help me grow in my current job and move forward in my career. These strategies give me the chance to learn from others and make valuable connections, leading to more success.</p>

                In terms of success, I am pleased with how much I have been able to accomplish in a short period. Gaining a solid understanding of the programming languages and cloud computing concepts has allowed me to start troubleshooting and fixing issues in the app. I can already see how these improvements will benefit the end-users, making their work more seamless.

                However, the most challenging aspect of the project has been the sheer volume of work still required. Despite the progress I have made, there is still a significant amount of work to be done to ensure the app is fully functional and user-friendly. The task of bringing everything together has been more overwhelming than anticipated, and I have to remain focused to meet my goal of completing the project within a week.

                Overall, I believe I have made good progress this week, and I am more confident in my ability to finish the project. Moving forward, I will need to prioritize tasks effectively and manage my time wisely to ensure I meet my deadline.
