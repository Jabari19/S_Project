            <h1>Module 1 Progress Report</h1>
            <p>This week, I worked 15 hours on the internship, bringing my total to 45 hours for the term. My goal for the week was to gather and organize healthcare data for analyzing provider performance. I made good progress in collecting data from different sources and started sorting it into categories, like patient outcomes and provider efficiency.
              One challenge I faced was dealing with missing or incomplete data. To address this, I cross-referenced multiple datasets and reached out to the team for clarification on specific entries. For next week, I plan to finish organizing the data and start creating visual summaries to highlight key performance trends.</p>
            
              <h1>Module 1 Journal</h1>
              <p>This week started really slow, but focussed on gathering and organizing more information that i will use in the coming weeks.This experince will help me to improve my attention to detail and problem-solving skills, which are important for working with data. I feel more confident in handling similar tasks in the future and see how this work is helping me grow professionally. </p>

            <h1>Module 2 Progress Report</h1>
            <p>I am on the early stages trying to understand my Senior Project despite that, my goal was to continue gathering more healthcare information/data in categories so that i can put them in charts to make my work easier. One challenge I faced was deciding the best way to visualize complex data for easier interpretation. To address this, I researched visualization techniques and tested different chart types, like bar graphs and scatter plots, to find the most effective ones. Next week, I plan to finalize the visual summaries and start preparing a report to share the findings with the team. </p>
