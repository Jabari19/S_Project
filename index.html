                <h3>Module 1 Progress Report</h3>
                <p>
                    This week, I worked 15 hours on the internship, bringing my total to 45 hours for the term. 
                    My goal for the week was to gather and organize healthcare data for analyzing provider performance. 
                    I made good progress in collecting data from different sources and started sorting it into categories, 
                    like patient outcomes and provider efficiency. One challenge I faced was dealing with missing or incomplete data. 
                    To address this, I cross-referenced multiple datasets and reached out to the team for clarification on specific entries. 
                    For next week, I plan to finish organizing the data and start creating visual summaries to highlight key performance trends.

                <p>
                    This week started really slow, but focused on gathering and organizing more information 
                    that I will use in the coming weeks. This experience will help me to improve my attention 
                    to detail and problem-solving skills, which are important for working with data. 
                    I feel more confident in handling similar tasks in the future and see how this work is helping me grow professionally.

                <h3>Module 2 Progress Report</h3>
                <p>
                    I am in the early stages of understanding my Senior Project. My goal this week was to continue gathering 
                    healthcare information and categorizing it for easier analysis. One challenge I faced was deciding the best 
                    way to visualize complex data for easier interpretation. To address this, I researched visualization techniques 
                    and tested different chart types, like bar graphs and scatter plots, to find the most effective ones. 
                    Next week, I plan to finalize the visual summaries and start preparing a report to share the findings with the team.

                <p>
                    I have to organize the data I collected so that I can visualize the summaries and identify which information 
                    belongs in charts or graphs. This will help highlight key patterns and trends. I plan to visit the library 
                    next week to see if I can find more information to enhance my project. This effort will help me improve my work.
