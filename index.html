                <h3>Module 1 Progress Report</h3>
                <p>
                    This week, I worked 15 hours on the internship, bringing my total to 45 hours for the term. 
                    My goal for the week was to gather and organize healthcare data for analyzing provider performance. 
                    I made good progress in collecting data from different sources and started sorting it into categories, 
                    like patient outcomes and provider efficiency. One challenge I faced was dealing with missing or incomplete data. 
                    To address this, I cross-referenced multiple datasets and reached out to the team for clarification on specific entries. 
                    For next week, I plan to finish organizing the data and start creating visual summaries to highlight key performance trends.

                <p>
                    This week started really slow, but focused on gathering and organizing more information 
                    that I will use in the coming weeks. This experience will help me to improve my attention 
                    to detail and problem-solving skills, which are important for working with data. 
                    I feel more confident in handling similar tasks in the future and see how this work is helping me grow professionally.

                <h3>Module 2 Progress Report</h3>
                <p>
                    I am in the early stages of understanding my Senior Project. My goal this week was to continue gathering 
                    healthcare information and categorizing it for easier analysis. One challenge I faced was deciding the best 
                    way to visualize complex data for easier interpretation. To address this, I researched visualization techniques 
                    and tested different chart types, like bar graphs and scatter plots, to find the most effective ones. 
                    Next week, I plan to finalize the visual summaries and start preparing a report to share the findings with the team.

                <p>
                    I have to organize the data I collected so that I can visualize the summaries and identify which information 
                    belongs in charts or graphs. This will help highlight key patterns and trends. I plan to visit the library 
                    next week to see if I can find more information to enhance my project. This effort will help me improve my work.

                <h3>Module 3 Progress Report</h3>
                <p>
                    I have spent a total of 12 hours on my internship this weekâ€”4 hours on Monday, 4 hours on Wednesday, and 4 hours on Friday. The first week was challenging as I gathered the necessary materials for the project. So far, I have collected books to support my research on the best methods for gathering and organizing healthcare data. This research will help me improve how I sort and analyze information, making it easier to identify key trends.
                    I believe I am meeting my goal because my progress is on the right track. Each step builds on the last, and I can see steady improvement in how I gather and organize healthcare data.
                    I am currently working on designing a program to assist with data organization and updates.
                    I am using Ruby, a programming language I have never used before. By next week, 
                    I plan to explore better ways to learn <b>Ruby</b> so I can effectively develop the program.

                <h3>Journal Entry Topic</h3>
                <p>Looking at healthcare software, EHR (Electronic Health Records), it was easy for me to identify some issues that can be fixed. It is slow and has some unnecessary features. I can take that software and clean it up by removing some of these unnecessary features, which I believe make the software lag, frustrating healthcare workers (nurses).
                    Last quarter, I studied database management systems, which I will also use in my project to help gather and organize data.
                    Last quarter, I also worked on a project in cloud computing, and I am very confident that if I apply it to my project, it will help store most data in the cloud and allow me to manage it more efficiently.</p>
                    <b>Soft Skills</b>
                    <p>I am a team player. I work really well with others, collaborating and helping team projects achieve a common goal.
                    I also adapt quickly to new tools or technology. For instance, I started learning Ruby, and I have come to like it.
                    I am good at time management, ensuring tasks are organized and completed on time to maintain productivity and meet deadlines, especially when juggling multiple projects. I like to prioritize tasks by identifying the most urgent ones and breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps.
